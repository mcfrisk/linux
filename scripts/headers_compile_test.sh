Execute in root directory of exported kernel headers in Linux kernel source
tree. Sets up gcc and libc headers without existing kernel headers to
a temporary environment and tries to compile all exported header files
from current directory against them. Return value is zero if all tests pass,
non-zero if something goes wrong during execution, or the amount of files
which failed the compile test.

Supported arguments:

    -h|--help       print help
    -k|--keep       don't cleanup temporary header files and directories
    -v|--verbose    print more verbose output

Example in Linux kernel source tree:

    \$ make headers_install
    \$ cd usr/include
    \$ $( readlink -f "$0" )
